# qbitunregistered

`qbitunregistered` is a powerful Python script for automating and managing a range of tasks in qBittorrent. It's designed to streamline the management of torrents with features for handling orphaned files, unregistered torrents, and more, all customizable through command-line arguments and a configuration file.

## Features

- **Orphaned File Checks**: Detect and report orphaned files to maintain a clean storage environment.
- **Unregistered Checks**: Identify and handle unregistered torrents based on user-defined configurations.
- **Tagging System**: Apply tags to torrents based on tracker source, age, and other criteria for easy organization.
- **Seeding Management**: Implement seed time and seed ratio limits to optimize seeding strategy.
- **Torrent Management**: Control torrent activity with pause, resume, and auto-management functions.
- **Automatic Removal**: Automatically remove torrents that meet specified conditions to manage space and ratio.
- **Hard Link Creation**: Generate hard links for completed downloads for better file management.
- **Dry Run Mode**: Test configurations and script behavior without making actual changes to your setup.
